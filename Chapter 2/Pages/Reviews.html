            <p>Super Smash Bros. (ニンテンドウオールスター! 大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ, Nintendo All-Star! Great Fray Smash Brothers), also called Super Smash Bros. 64, often shortened to SSB or Smash 64, is the first game of the Super Smash Bros. series.

                The game released in Japan on January 21st, 1999, in North America on April 26th, 1999 and in Europe on November 19th, 1999 for the Nintendo 64. Subsequently, it released on the iQue Player in China on November 15th, 2005. It was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console on January 20th, 2009 in Japan, a day before its 10-year anniversary, and later that year in Europe and North America, before becoming unavailable after the Wii Shop Channel shut down on January 30th, 2019.
                
                Super Smash Bros. received positive reviews, with most praise going to its multiplayer mode, while its single-player mode received some criticism. The game has sold 5 million units worldwide as of 2001, making it the fifth best-selling Nintendo 64 game of all time.</p>

                Smash Bros. is an incredibly addictive multiplayer game, but it really doesn't offer much challenge in single-player mode.

                    When this came out it was a complete surprise to me, I hadn’t really heard of it. I just rented it out from Blockbuster for something me and my friend to play, and we had a real blast! It was so much pure fun. Sadly it took forever to find a copy to buy as prices for it shot up quickly, I think by the time I actually found a copy I felt was a reasonable price it was during the hype for the up-coming release of Melee! Still, I may not have played it as much as the others, but it’s still a pleasant memory for me.

                It's fun, addictive and it's got a superb multi-player mode. ... A highly addictive and satisfying game. Super Smash Bros. is a classic game for the Nintendo 64.
