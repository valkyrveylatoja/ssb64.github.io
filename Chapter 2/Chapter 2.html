        <h2>
            <p>Super Smash Bros. (ニンテンドウオールスター! 大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ, Nintendo All-Star! Great Fray Smash Brothers), also called Super Smash Bros. 64, often shortened to SSB or Smash 64, is the first game of the Super Smash Bros. series.

                The game released in Japan on January 21st, 1999, in North America on April 26th, 1999 and in Europe on November 19th, 1999 for the Nintendo 64. Subsequently, it released on the iQue Player in China on November 15th, 2005. It was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console on January 20th, 2009 in Japan, a day before its 10-year anniversary, and later that year in Europe and North America, before becoming unavailable after the Wii Shop Channel shut down on January 30th, 2019.
                
                Super Smash Bros. received positive reviews, with most praise going to its multiplayer mode, while its single-player mode received some criticism. The game has sold 5 million units worldwide as of 2001, making it the fifth best-selling Nintendo 64 game of all time.</p>

                </h3>
                Mario (マリオ, Mario) appears as a starter character in Super Smash Bros. He is considered an "all-around" character (like in most games) due to his relatively balanced attributes, a trait that has carried on with him in subsequent games.

                </h3>
                Donkey Kong (ドンキーコング, Donkey Kong), written as DK, is a starter character in Super Smash Bros. He has slow, yet powerful attacks, like his trademark move: the Giant Punch. Due to this, his archetype has also inspired the archetype for most of the heavyweight characters in subsequent games, in which he has also appeared. His voice clips mostly use gorilla grunts and sounds.

                </h3>
                Link (リンク, Link) appears as a starter character in Super Smash Bros. He is the sole fighter from The Legend of Zelda series. Link is perhaps the most well-equipped character with either long ranged and melee options of attack, with two projectiles (which would become three in later iterations), his long-reaching Master Sword and his Hookshot. His design is based on his appearance as an adult in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

                    Samus (サムス, Samus) is a starter character in Super Smash Bros. As in her games, she fights inside the hi-tech, powerful Varia Suit, giving her a strong endurance to attacks as well as varied options for attack. Her sound clips are entirely "technologic" sounds.

                    Kirby (カービィ, Kirby) is a starter character in Super Smash Bros. He is known for being a small, light character with quick and often surprisingly long ranged attacks, as well as surprisingly strong moves and a great recovery. He is voiced by Makiko Ōmoto, who would go on to voice him in most subsequent appearances.

                    Pikachu (ピカチュウ, Pikachu) is a starter character in Super Smash Bros. It originates from the Pokémon series, being its recognizable mascot. Pikachu is generally a light, quick character, which would serve as the archetype for some other lightweight characters in the series. Pikachu is voiced by Ikue Ōtani, who voices it in the anime, and other game appearances.

                Luigi (ルイージ, Luigi) appears in Super Smash Bros. as one of the four unlockable characters. He is a clone of Mario, keeping most of his moves and animations, though differing in terms of attributes. High-pitched versions of Mario's Super Mario 64 voice clips, originally performed by Charles Martinet, serve as Luigi's voice.

                    </h3>
                    Jigglypuff (プリン, Purin) is an unlockable character in Super Smash Bros. Mainly included due to its popularity in the anime at the time, Jigglypuff is notable for its similar appearance and nature to Kirby, and the fact that they share a lot of moves makes them semi-clones. It is the floatiest and lightest character in the game, a trait it has kept in subsequent appearances.

Falcon, is the main character from the F-Zero franchise, and appears in Super Smash Bros. as one of the four unlockable characters.

                    When this came out it was a complete surprise to me, I hadn’t really heard of it. I just rented it out from Blockbuster for something me and my friend to play, and we had a real blast! It was so much pure fun. Sadly it took forever to find a copy to buy as prices for it shot up quickly, I think by the time I actually found a copy I felt was a reasonable price it was during the hype for the up-coming release of Melee! Still, I may not have played it as much as the others, but it’s still a pleasant memory for me.
